# go-isocountries
A useful list of ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code constants for Go.

The package contains a named string type and a whole bunch of constants representing three letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3).

Currently it does not contain special codes like unofficial ones, NATO codes, and disputed zones, but these will be added soon.
